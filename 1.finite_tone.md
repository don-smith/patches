# Finite Tone

This is one of the most basic patches in modular synthesis. The result is a tone that has a distinct beginning and end with the optional ability to create a specific pitch.

Along with a module to hear the result, you will need:

1. A voice. An oscillator, a filter capable of self-oscillation, or a any module that can generate a constant audio rate signal (e.g. a looping sampler).
2. An envelope generator. This only needs to have a trigger input and an output, although most will have a way to control the rise and fall of the envelope either using CV or physically with knobs/faders.
3. A VCA. Any voltage controlled amplifier/attenuator should do.
4. A trigger source. Typically a sequencer or keyboard is used, but a clock source will also work (e.g. a clock divider or euclidean module). A lot of envelope generators also have a physical button you can press to create a trigger.

This is a diagram of the final patch

Step 1: Create a drone

This step is just to ensure you can hear some sound before we move on. Patch the output of your voice module to the input of your output device (the module connected to your audio interface/speakers). You should now hear the constant sound of your voice module through your speakers.

Step 2. Incorporate the VCA

Disconnect your output module and patch the output of your voice module to the input of your VCA. Then patch the output of your VCA to the output module. You may or may not hear your voice now depending on how the CV input on your VCA is designed. If you can twist some knobs on your VCA to hear the constant sound, great, but if not, don't worry, you will soon.

Step 2: Control the VCA with the envelope

Patch the output of the envelope generator to the CV input of your VCA. If you were hearing it before, you probably won't now because your envelope isn't sending your VCA any control voltage yet. For it to do that, you need to trigger it. If your envelope generator has a physical trigger button, using it should trigger a sound you can hear.

Step 3: Trigger the envelope generator

Patch the output of your trigger source to the trigger input of your envelope generator. Now each time the trigger fires, your envelope generator will send CV to your VCA to open it up in a specific way based on the attack/rise and sustain/fall of your envelope generator. Adjust these settings while continuing to send triggers and notice how it changes the duration of the tone.

Step 4: Control a filter with the envelope

If the patch above is the most common patch is synthesis, the inclusion of a filter in this way is the second most common. Using a multiple, send the envelope to the VCA and a VCF. Re-patch the output of the VCA through a filter to your output. Adjust your filter's cutoff and other parameters to give some movement to the finite tone.

Step 5: Send pitch and gate from a keyboard or sequencer

And if our journey so far is the most common patches, this is the next logical addition. Patch the pitch of your keyboard/sequencer to the 1 volt/octave input on your oscillator. Replace the trigger input on your envelope generator with the gate output of your keyboard/sequencer. Now you can play your instrument in a much more traditional way (if that's your thing).
